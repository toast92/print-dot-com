# Print.com Code Challenge

## Going over the assignment
- As a first step I made a small sketch of what I think the page should look like. After that, I thought about how to use the time as wisely as possible, and decided that for now I would skip the validation part as that would be the most time consuming for me, quality > quantity. 
- Since there is no specific design or UX requirements, I made the decision to use Vuetify as I am somewhat familiar with it and it helps with UX decisions (animations, etc)
- As a first commit I decided to clone the project and have a clean installation of Vue
