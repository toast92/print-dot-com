# Print.com Code Challenge

## Going over the assignment
- As a first step I made a small sketch of what I think the page should look like. After that, I thought about how to use the time as wisely as possible, and decided that for now I would skip the validation part as that would be the most time consuming for me, quality > quantity. 
- Since there is no specific design or UX requirements, I made the decision to use Vuetify as I am somewhat familiar with it and it helps with UX decisions (animations, etc)
- As a first commit I decided to clone the project and have a clean installation of Vue
- I continued with making use of Vuetify's app-bar to quickly implement a navigation bar. I set up the routes for the 3 types of products and created 3 separate views for them that only included the name of the product so far. 
- I also added a shopping cart that opens up a mocked list of items when clicked. This is temporary as I will replace it wtith the actual products added :)
- Next step is to go over the data for the products and display it on the views I cerated per product.
